Creating installable PyScript applications that cache assets and runs offline
offer enormous potential for Python. In this article, I will show you how to
create a Python application that installs on the desktop and on mobile devices.
This application will continue to function with no Internet connection. The
PyScript and Pyodide files are cached by the application significantly reducing
startup time. In my opinion, this will be a killer feature that will allow
Python to be a major web development language.
